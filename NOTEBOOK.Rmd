title: "Data Mining NOTEBOOK"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Left out Standardization:

```{r}
Standardize <- function(x){return((x - min(x))/ (max(x) - min(x)))}

cleand2$Temperature <- Standardize(cleand2$Temperature)
cleand2$Humidity <- Standardize(cleand2$Humidity)
cleand2$Light <- Standardize(cleand2$Light)
cleand2$CO2 <- Standardize(cleand2$CO2)
cleand2$HumidityRatio <- Standardize(cleand2$HumidityRatio)
cleand2$Occupancy <- Standardize(cleand2$Occupancy)

View(cleand2)
summary(cleand2)

```

# wrong labels (should be the label; 6; occupancy)

```{r}
train_df_test <- cleand_test[1:7000,]
testd_df_test <- cleand_test[7000:8143,]

train_label_test <- cleand_test[1:7000, 1]
test_label_test <- cleand_test[7000:8143, 1]
```

# knn learning code (square root which is an equal number and head reveals outcomes not related to label (should be noticed))

```{r}

Occupancy_pred_review <- knn(train_df_review,testd_df_review, train_label_review, k= 90) 

head(Occupancy_pred_review)

```

# as a result of wrong knn learning learning code and wrong labels, the confusion matrix cannot be ran

# after adjusting labels and learning code, the confusion matrix can run. However, if standardizatio has not been taken into account, the outcomes will have no value.
